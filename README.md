# Linear-Transformation-Playground
This project simulates 2-dimensional linear transformations, as well as vectors and vector operations. The code uses Python 3.11 and uses the numpy, matplotlib and the math module.

- *Cartesian Plane*: Set up a clean Cartesian plane with arrows, grid lines, and a visually appealing layout. A user can set the axes of the grid on line 7, in the constructor. 
- *Vector Operations*: Plot vectors and perform operations like scaling, matrix transformations, and more.
- *Matrix Manipulation*: Explore matrix operations, determinants, eigenvalues, and matrix multiplication.
- *Dot Product and Angle Calculation*: Calculate dot products, magnitudes, and angles between vectors.
- *Cross Product*: Find the cross product of two vectors.
